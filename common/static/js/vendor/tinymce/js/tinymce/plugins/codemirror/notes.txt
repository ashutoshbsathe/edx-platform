Observations :

1) There is a plugin called codemirror for tinymce available here : https://github.com/christiaan/tinymce-codemirror
2) The good thing about the plugin is that you can use any version of codemirror in your code and it will work perfectly fine
3) This plugin is already in use in the OpenEdx repository. The exact path is given by : https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/tree/master/common/static/js/vendor/tinymce/js/tinymce/plugins/codemirror
4) I have created a demo sort of repo for this plugin which can be found here : https://github.com/ashutoshbsathe/codemirror-in-tinymce
5) My demo uses tinymce 4.7.0 and codemirror 5.38.0 and they work really well
6) We can configure the codemirror to suit our needs and it will be ready to work.
7) There is a xblock module [or as they like to call it, just an "xblock"] called html_module.py that handles the operation of html editor in openedx,
   it is located here : https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/common/lib/xmodule/xmodule/html_module.py
8) This is the module that loads the html editor widget and configures both(tinymce and codemirror) editors to work hand in hand with the help of plugin,
   which I talked earlier(point 1)

"So if it was this easy, why they did not update it on their own ?" :
Probably, fully fledged HTML editor isn't their selling point and they don't want to invest their time in upgrading something that actually works.
And also, they might've thought "This is easy stuff" and might've left this responsibility to the system admin who is configuring the server for work.
This I think is analogous to android kernels. The older kernel works just perfect and hence most OEMs donot invest their time in upgrading the kernel 
even though the kernel maybe easily "upstream-able" to the latest linux-stable.
